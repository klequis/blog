## Syntax highlighting

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

````
```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

## Footnotes

```
Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.

## Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear ~~crossed out~~.
