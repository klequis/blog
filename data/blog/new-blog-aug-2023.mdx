summary: My new blog
---

I'm in the process of converting my blog from Gatsby.js to Next.js using a [template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) created by Timothy Lin ([timlrx](https://www.timlrx.com/)). I'm currently migrating the `.md` files from the old blog to the new one.

So far, since I have content I need to get created, I haven't made any changes to the template other than substituting information about [timlrx](https://www.timlrx.com/) with mine.

## Frontmatter

My Gatsby blog had some frontmatter fields in common with the new blog but other than `title` they were named different. For example, `publishedDate` is now `date`. I also had some custom fields that for now I'm not going to bring across. It likely isn't worth your time looking at but in the event it is, [here is a mapping from old to new frontmatter](https://github.com/klequis/blog/wiki/Migrating-from-old-site)

## `.md` to `.mdx`

Since my existing files have not JSX in them I could leave the file extension as `.md` but decided to make them all `.mdx` to be consistent.

## Not needed?

mdx supports [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/) markdown syntax and thus does not support all markdown syntax extensions supported by [GitHub flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). This additional syntax can be added via the [`remark-gmf`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm). For more information on this subject [see the README for `remark-gmf`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm).
