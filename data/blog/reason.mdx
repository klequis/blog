summary: 'You decide which is right, and which is an illusion'

I was reading [this article on UFOs](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230726-the-weird-incidents-piquing-nasas-interest) today and realized there were only 2 possible scenarios.

1. The aliens are here. They have a variety of craft with dynamics that defy the laws of physics as we understand them, and the US government has possession of some of their technology.
2. There have always been a variety of biological creatures that feed on CO2 and can fly, defying the laws of physics as we understand them. In the past these creatures were so rare that no one noticed them. However, now that we have increased the carbon in the atmosphere by 150% since 1960, these creatures are reproducing rapidly and therefore getting noticed more.

These are the only two retional possibilities. You can decide for your self which one is true, which is your right for whatever reason you believe it to be your right. However, if you choose #1 you will be wrong. The truth is #2. I know this because the creatures are speaking to me, and as far as I know, only me. I am writing down what they have to say and when there is sufficient information to make it worthwhile you're reading, I will release it as a book. You will know that #2 is true because it is clearly stated in the book. What is in the book is true because the creatures told me to write it there.

I intend to create a new world religion based on these divine creatures. As will be clearly stated in the book and therefore true because the creatures said it is, this new religion will have 4 billion followers by the time of my passing in 2084 at the age of 125.

The creatures have instructed me to publish the book for free even though I and they know full well, once enough people are sufficiently deceived and hooked on it, I will start charging.
